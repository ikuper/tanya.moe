#All Hail Tanya! Tanya: The best Waifu. Ever.
Before I start anything, huge thanks to Pizzacus for such quality post, it gave me inspiration for my ITGS IA.

This is a website for those who wanna praise Tanya. I built this website for my School Project, ITGS IA. You can actually browse it at <http://tanya.moe>

## Special Thanks to
  * Pizzacus for the amazing website by him/ his team.
  * twenty for being my client
  * Everyone else who gave me mental support when I wanna gave up on creating this website...

## Getting started

* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch` or `yarn global add brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`
* Run:
    * `npm start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `npm run build` — builds minified project for production
* About our building system:
    * We use [Brunch](http://brunch.io) to build tanya.moe, brunch performs many tasks such as minifying data, compacting the files, ect...
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server. The code is in the `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
